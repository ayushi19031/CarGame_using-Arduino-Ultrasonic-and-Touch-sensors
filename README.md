# CarGame_using-Arduino-Ultrasonic-and-Touch-sensors
A fun car game using arduino uno and touch sensor and ultrasonic sensor

This was a group project. It involved Ayush Madhan Sohini(ayush19156@iiitd.ac.in) and Avishi Gupta(avishi19155@iiitd.ac.in) and myself(ayushij2704@gmail.com). We made a car game in which the cars can be controlled by touch sensor and ultrasonic sensor.
It can be played as a single player as well as multiplayer game. In case of single player, if the car hits the obstacle, the player loses. If the score is above 50 points, a green flash can be displayed on the remote control. Else a red flash is displayed. In case of double player game, the car which hits the incoming obstacles first loses. 

# ITEMS AND SOFTWARES USED

1. Arduino Uno
2. Arduino
3. Processing
4. Ultrasonic sensor
5. Touch sensor
6. 3D printing used to print remote control device. Further, AutoCAD-Fusion360 was used to design the console.
7. Use of images from internet to make game attractive.

# HOW IT WORKS

When the console moves up, the ultrasonic sensor detects increase in height, due to which the message is sent to aruduino and car moves left. Similarly, console moved down for car to shift to right. For car to speed up or slow down, touch sensors are used. Similarly,to restart game, we use touch sensor.
